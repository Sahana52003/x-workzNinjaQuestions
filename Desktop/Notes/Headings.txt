List:

	An HTML List allows you to organize data on web pages into an ordered or unordered format to make the information easier to read and visually appealing. HTML Lists are very helpful for creating structured, accessible content in web development.

Types of HTML Lists:

There are three main types of lists in HTML:

1.Unordered Lists (<ul>): These lists are used for items that do not need to be in any specific order. The list items are typically marked with bullets.
	Eg: <ul>
    <li>Item 1</li>
    <li>Item 2</li>
    <li>Item 3</li>
</ul>

2.Ordered Lists (<ol>): These lists are used when the order of the items is important. Each item in an ordered list is typically marked with numbers or letters.
	Eg: <ol>
   <li>Item1</li>
   <li>Item2</li>
   <li>Item3</li>
</ol>

3.Description Lists (<dl>): These lists are used to contain terms and their corresponding descriptions.
	Eg:<dl>
    <dt>Item 1</dt>
    <dd>Description of Item 1 </dd>
    <dt>Item 2</dt>
    <dd>Description of Item 2</dd>
</dl>


Tables:
	HTML tables are used to organize and display data in a grid format, with rows and columns. They are created using the <table> element, with <tr> for rows, <th> for table headers, and <td> for table data.


Have 3 types:
1.<tr>: (Table Row)===>The <tr> tag in HTML is used to define a row in a table. It is a container for table cells, which can be either <td> (data cell) or <th> (header cell). The <tr> tag is placed inside a <table> element and groups cells horizontally.
2.<th>: (Table Header)===>The <th> tag in HTML is used to set the header cell of a table. The working of both tags (<th> and <td>) are the same, but the text properties are different. In <th> text is bold and centered, and in <td> text is regular and left aligned by default.
3.<td>: (Table Data)===>The <td> tag defines a standard data cell in an HTML table, used to contain content such as text, images, or numbers within a table row (<tr>).

Eg:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Firstname</th>
            <th>Lastname</th>
            <th>Age</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Sora</td>
            <td>V</td>
            <td>24</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>JK</td>
            <td>V</td>
            <td>32</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Sam</td>
            <td>Wat</td>
            <td>41</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
</body>
</html>



Iframes:
	Called as Internal Frames.
	The <iframe> tag in HTML is used to embed another webpage or external content within the current webpage. It creates an inline frame, allowing users to view content from a different URL or file without leaving the page. Common attributes include src to specify the URL, width and height to set the frame size, title for accessibility, and frameborder to control the border. The <iframe> tag is often used to display videos, maps, or interactive content, making it a useful tool for integrating external resources.
	Eg: <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dQw4w9WgXcQ" 
        width="560" height="315" 
        title="YouTube video player" 
        frameborder="0" 
        allowfullscreen>
</iframe>





Forms:
	TML forms, defined using the <form> Tags are essential for collecting user input on web pages. They incorporate a variety of interactive controls such as text fields, numeric inputs, email fields, password fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, and submit buttons.

		Eg: <!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Simple Form</title>
</head>
